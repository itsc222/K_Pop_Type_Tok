Oh yeah
I guarantee I gotcha

I’ve been craving for your love
Can’t see nobody but us
so I so I so I

See you from across the room
Make my way over to you
I’m trippin’ over butterflies

Oh yeah baby I don’t really mean to rush
but Imma really need your touch
If Imma make it thru the night

I got the moonlight
Tequila sunrise
Come take a shot on me, I gotcha

I don’t know how to say this
I hope this song is on your playlist
this feelings so hard to explain
I don’t even know how to talk right now
its i need you o’clock right now
I want you to hear me say

moonlight sunrise
baby come be my starlight
moonlight sunrise
Oh baby
Just to make you stay

moonlight sunrise
baby let’s do it all night
moonlight sunrise
I guarantee I gotcha

Loving undefeated on your knees pleading
baby u can hit up my line when you need it
said that you tried baby you succeeded
Got a craving baby
Can u feed it

Took a trip under moonlight
Follow me to the sunrise
everyday everynight
Ayyyy, come with me don’t think twice

Oh yeah baby I don’t really mean to rush
but Imma really need your touch
If Imma make it thru the night

I got the moonlight
Tequila sunrise
Come take a shot on me, I gotcha

I don’t know how to say this
I hope this song is on your playlist
this feelings so hard to explain

I don’t even know how to talk right now
its i need you o’clock right now
I want you to hear me say

moonlight sunrise

Oh baby
Just to make you stay
