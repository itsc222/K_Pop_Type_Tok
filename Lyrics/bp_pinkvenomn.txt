Kick in the door, waving the coco
팝콘이나 챙겨 껴들 생각 말고
I talk that talk, runways I walk walk
눈 감고 Pop pop 안 봐도 척

One by one then two by two
내 손끝 툭 하나에 다 무너지는 중
가짜 쇼 치곤 화려했지
Makes no sense, you couldn’t get a dollar outta me

자 오늘 밤이야
난 독을 품은 꽃
네 혼을 빼앗은 다음
Look what you made us do
천천히 널 잠재울 Fire
잔인할 만큼 아름다워
I bring the pain like

This that pink venom
This that pink venom
This that pink venom
Get ‘em, get ‘em, get ‘em
Straight to ya dome like whoa whoa whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah ah ah

Taste that pink venom
Taste that pink venom
Taste that pink venom
Get ‘em, get ‘em, get ‘em
Straight to ya dome like whoa whoa whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah ah ah

Black paint and ammo, got bodies like Rambo
Rest in peace, please light up a candle
This da life of a vandal, masked up and I’m still in Celine
Designer crimes or it wouldn’t be me

Diamonds shinin’ drive in silence
I don’t mind it I’m ridin’
Flyin’ private side by side with da pilot up in the sky
And I’m wildin’, stylin’ on them and there’s no chance
Cuz we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance

자 오늘 밤이야
난 독을 품은 꽃
니 혼을 빼앗은 다음
Look what you made us do
천천히 널 잠재울 Fire
잔인할 만큼 아름다워
I bring the pain like

This that pink venom
This that pink venom
This that pink venom
Get ‘em, get ‘em, get ‘em
Straight to ya dome like whoa whoa whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah ah ah

Taste that pink venom
Taste that pink venom
Taste that pink venom
Get ‘em, get ‘em, get ‘em
Straight to ya dome like whoa whoa whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah ah ah

원한다면 Provoke us
감당 못해 And you know this
이미 퍼져버린 Shot that potion
니 눈앞은 핑크빛 Ocean

Come and give me all the smoke
도 아니면 모 Like I’m so rock and roll
Come and give me all the smoke
[지/로] 다 줄 세워 봐 자 Stop drop

I bring the pain like

Ratatata ratatata
Ratatata ratatata
Ratatata ratatata
Straight to ya
Straight to ya
Straight to ya dome like

Ratatata ratatata
Ratatata ratatata
Ratatata ratatata
I bring the pain like
